# React Resume PDF

See the medium article [here](https://medium.com/@wkwok16/lets-make-a-resume-in-react-2c9c5540f51a)

Feel welcome to use this if you would like, for your own resume or website! Note that kendo-ui is a commercial product. I am personally looking for ways to replace it, and will be removing it from my website if I cannot find a replacement. 

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
